## Description

Place CRDT is a recreation of Redditâ€™s r/place that allows users to place pixels without the need for an internet connection.

It is a 40-by-40 pixel board (1600 total pixels) that supports concurrent placement of multiple pixels with different colors. Live pixel placements are supported where changes happen in real-time and are thus viewable by all users connected to the site.
